// This file contains a few instructions that we will follow throughout the course of the project. Most of these instrctions are the industry best practises that we also want to follow. Lets work the professional way.

/**
 * ===== PROJECT MANAGEMENT =====
 * when you are going to start a task check that the task is assigned to you.
 * If not, assign it to yourself if not assigned to anyone
 * 
 * The project runs under github projects. This is where all the tasks are categorised in to three columns
 * first column is "Todo", second is "In progess", and third is "done"
 * 
 * All tasks/issues before started are in the "Todo" column and should be moved to the "In progress tab" when the person has
 * started working on it. This can be done by draggin the task between columns.
 * 
 * Anyone can also create a new issue/task when they feel that the it deserves to be on the project. This can be done by;
 * 1. clicking on the "Issues" tab on the project repo 
 * 2. Add short title and detailed information on what the task sould cover
 * 3. You can add assignee or leave it for someone to pick up
 * 4. Add a corresponding label for the issue/task
 * 5. Assign it to the corresponding project and in this case "Node Webscrapper"
 * 
 */

/**
 * ===== COMMITS ======
 * 1. Try to have small commits for easy follow up. 
 * 2. commits should be in present tense
 * 3. commits shouk be precise/short and understandable
 * 4. Avoid commit large changes. try to commit after every small change so that it's easy to roll back effectively in time

  /**
   * ===== REVIEWING PULL REQUESTS
   * Lets try to add reviewers, badges as well as the project to which the project belongs.
   * These can be found by the right of the pull request. 
   * 
   * We want to keep a short life span of a Pull request to a maximum of 2 days so that we do not block other tasks that
   * might be depending on the  functionality implemented by the PR. Therefore let's try to remind each other to review 
   * each others PR once its ready to fasten the devlopment process.
   * 
   * Lets also review each other's work in a professional way giving constructive feedback in a kind way because we are all
   * aiming to improving our skills to be world class developers ready to be employable by any company available or 
   * creating companies that extend that kind of emotions of peace, love and collaboration.
   *

   /**
    * ===== EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION =====
    * lets try to keep in touch as much as we can. /if you have issues that might not be completed in time, please let
    * the team know about this so that we can find a way to deal with it early and not have the project stall midway.

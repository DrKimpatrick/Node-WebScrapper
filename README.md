# Node-Facebook-WebScrapper
> A web scrapper that scraps a Facebook group and performs a couple of tasks.

The Webscrapper manages and automates tasks on a facebook group provided you have the group username and password.
The scrapper will be used to collect analytics data from the facebook group, accept group requests for users to join, collect information on current group members among many other tools. 

We look forward to using this idea to be able to gather online analytics not only from facebook but also from other websites.

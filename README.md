# Node-Facebook-WebScrapper
> A web scrapper that scraps a Facebook group and performs a couple of tasks.

The Webscrapper manages and automates tasks on a facebook group provided you have the group username and password.
The scrapper will be used to collect analytics data from a web source like a website/web application. Some of the test sources will include Facebook profiles, pages and groups. The end goal is to be able to automate activities on the web using NodeJS.

We look forward to using this idea to be able to gather online analytics not only from facebook but also from other websites.
